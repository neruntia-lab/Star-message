# Star Message

This Foundry VTT module lets you mark chat messages with a star so they cannot be deleted manually or when clearing the chat log. Compatible with Foundry VTT 12 and 13.

## Usage

After installing the module, each chat message will have a star icon in the top left corner. Click the star to protect the message. Protected messages are highlighted with a solid yellow star and cannot be removed until unstarred.
